to use this, install XAMPP (from https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html). for mac users please dont download the one in this link that ends in "-vm.dmg". download any of the mac ones without that. for windows users any should be fine

After installing: (MAC) go to Applications/XAMPP/xamppfiles/htdocs and drag the ATSPHP2 folder into there
(WINDOWs) drag the ATSPHP2 into the htdocs folder where you installed xampp, eg C:/xampp/htdocs

To use the DB.

open XAMPP and switch on Apache and MySQL. (for mac i believe the app itself is called manager-osx so click manage servers and start "mySQL database" and "Apache Web Server". )

then go to localhost/phpmyadmin, create a new db called ats and once you click on ats, go to the top and press import. import the ats.sql that is in the folder (same directory as this file).

you can access the actual website by going localhost/atsphp2/templates
